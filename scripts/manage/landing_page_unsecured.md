## Use Spinnaker

### Forward Port to Deck

```bash
~/spinnaker-for-gcp/scripts/manage/connect_unsecured.sh
```

### Connect to Deck

<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer
    spotlightId="devshell-web-preview-button"
    text="Connect to Spinnaker via 'Preview on port 8080'">
</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>

### Expose Spinnaker

If you would like to connect to Spinnaker without relying on port forwarding, we can
expose it via a secure domain behind the [Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/).

Note that this phase could take 30-60 minutes. Spinnaker will be inaccessible during this time.

```bash
~/spinnaker-for-gcp/scripts/expose/configure_endpoint.sh
```
