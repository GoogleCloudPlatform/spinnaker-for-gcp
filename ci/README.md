# Installing Spinnaker for GCP on a Continous Integration Server

Spinnaker for GCP supports installation through a continous integration Server. A CI server can be used to conduct the initial installation and to apply updates when the Spinnaker for GCP properties file changes. Solutions for [Google Cloud Build](CLOUD_BUILD.md) and [Jenkins](JENKINS.md) are available.
