      # Manage your Spinnaker
      [Open management console in Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?shellonly=true&cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spinnaker-for-gcp.git&cloudshell_working_dir=scripts/manage&cloudshell_tutorial=landing_page_expanded.md&cloudshell_print=instructions.txt)

      Ensure you're connected to the correct GKE Cluster from within Cloud Shell. Follow the instructions in the management console to check the Kubernetes context you are using and update it if necessary.

      # Connect to your Spinnaker
      Follow the link above to establish port forwarding via Cloud Shell. Note that you can securely expose your Spinnaker via that link as well so it can be directly accessed in the future.
